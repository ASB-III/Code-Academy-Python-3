    "You have created a robotics company which began with four-wheeled driving robots, but you are now expanding the technology to include bipedal robots. Since a lot of robotic logic already exists from the driving robot, we can modularize the robot class structure using object oriented programming concepts such as inheritance. These five advanced challenge problems will test your knowledge of classes and interactions between multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Robot Inheritance\n",
    "The generic variables and methods have been placed into a Robot class for you. You will need to create two new classes. One for DriveBot and one for WalkBot. Both of these should inherit from the Robot class. The constructor for the DriveBot will be essentially the same as the superclass constructor, but the WalkBot constructor will include an extra parameter for an instance variable called step_length. Here is what we need to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Create a new class called DriveBot which inherits from the Robot class\n",
    "#### 2. Call the superclass constructor within the DriveBot constructor but pass motor_speed as the parameter for speed in the super class\n",
    "#### 3. Create a new class called WalkBot which inherits from the Robot class\n",
    "#### 4. Add another parameter to the WalkBot constructor for step_length which defaults to 5\n",
    "#### 5. Call the superclass constructor within the constructor for the WalkBot class\n",

The speed of the DriveBot will be represented by the motor_speed. You can pass in motor_speed as a parameter in the superclass constructor. The next class is the WalkBot class. This class should also use the Robot constructor, but the speed is represented by steps_per_minute which you can pass into the superclass constructor. Additionally, the WalkBot constructor should include another parameter for step_length. This should default to 5 if not provided and should be assigned to an instance variable called step_length.\n",

    "Finally, we are going to make some last additions to our bipedal robot and test it out. Your customers are worried that your new robot model might become sentient when controlled in large numbers. To prevent this, program the bipedal robots so that if five WalkBots are created when there are already at least 5 DriveBots (causing 10 or more total bots) then disable all robots. This is what you need to do:\n",
