Syntax Errors
When we are writing Python programs, the interpreter is our first line of defense against errors.

SyntaxError means there is something wrong with the way your program is written ‚Äî punctuation that does not belong, a command where it is not expected, or a missing parenthesis can all trigger a SyntaxError.

Here‚Äôs an example of a SyntaxError error message:

File "script.py", line 1
  print(Hello world!)
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
The interpreter will tell us where (the file name and line number) it got into trouble and its best guess as to what is wrong.

After reading the error message, we can assume that the cause for this error is a lack of quotation marks around Hello world!.

Some common syntax errors are:

Misspelling a Python keyword.
Missing colon :.
Missing closing parenthesis ), square bracket ], or curly brace }.
Instructions
1.
In script.py, your coworker Carolyn wrote a Fortune Cookie program that is supposed to print out a possible fortune based on a random number and an if/elif/else statement.

Run the program to check it out.

2.
Oh no, there are three SyntaxError errors inside script.py!

Can you find them all?


Stuck? Get a hint

# Fortune Cookie Program ü•†

import random

fortune = random.randint(0, 4)

if fortune == 0:
  print("May you one day be carbon neutral")
elif fortune == 1:  
  print("You have rice in your teeth")
elif fortune == 2:
  print("No snowflake feels responsible for an avalanche")
elif fortune == 3:
  print("You can only connect the dots looking backwards")
elif fortune == 4:
  print("The fortune you seek is in another cookie")

Name Errors
A NameError is reported by the Python interpreter when it detects a variable that is unknown.

This can occur if a variable is used before it has been assigned a value or if a variable name is spelled differently than the point at which it was defined. The Python interpreter will display the line of code where the NameError was detected and indicate which name is found that was not defined.

Here‚Äôs an example of a NameError error message:

File "script.py", line 1, in <module>
    print(score)
NameError: name 'score' is not defined
This error is suggesting that the variable score was never defined in the program. Oops.

Some common name errors are:

Misspelling a variable name.
Forgetting to define a variable.
Instructions
1.
In script.py, another teammate Alex wrote a Who Wants to Be A Millionaire question and four options. If the answer is an uppercase or lowercase ‚ÄúA‚Äù, then the score goes up.

Run the program to check it out.


Hint
In case you were wondering, the \n escape sequence simply prints a new line in the terminal.

2.
Oh no, there are two NameError errors!

Can you find them both?


Hint
There will be an error message when the program is run:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "script.py", line 13, in <module>
    print("C.", option3)
NameError: name 'option3' is not defined
In script.py, on line 13, a variable option3 is not defined.

Can you find the other bug? üêõ

Note: Usually the error is on the exact line indicated by the interpreter, or the line of code just before it; however, if the problem is incorrectly nested braces, the actual error may be at the beginning of the nested block.

# Who Wants To Be A Millionaire üí∞ 

score = 0

option1 = 'Fresca'
option2 = 'V8'
option3 = 'dr. pepper'
option4 = 'A&W'
  
print("For ordering his favorite beverages on demand, LBJ had four buttons installed in the Oval Office labeled 'Coffee', 'Tea', 'Coke', and what?\n")

print("A.", option1)
print("B.", option2)
print("C.", option3)
print("D.", option4)
  
answer = 'a'

if answer == 'A' or answer == 'a': 
  score += 100
  print("\nCorrect!")
else:
  print("\nNope, sorry!")

Type Errors

A TypeError is reported by the Python interpreter when an operation is applied to a variable of an inappropriate type.

This can occur in Python when one attempts to use an operator on something of the incorrect type.

For example, let‚Äôs see what happens when we try and add together two incompatible types:

piggy_bank = '2' + 0.25
There will be an TypeError error message:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "script.py", line 1, in <module>
    piggy_bank = '2' + 0.25
TypeError: must be str, not float
This error is reporting that 0.25 is not a string.

Some common type errors are:

Accidentally adding or subtracting a string value.
Call a function on something of the incorrect type.

# Area Calculator üìè

import math

base = 20
height = 30
area = base * height / 2

print("The triangle area is", area)

length = 2
width = 12
area = length * width

print("The rectangle area is", area )
    
radius = 36
area = math.pi * radius * radius
    
print("The circle area is", area)

Review
Finding bugs is a huge part of a programmer‚Äôs life. Don‚Äôt be intimidated by them! In fact, errors in your code mean you‚Äôre trying to do something cool.

In this lesson, we have learned about the three types of Python errors:

SyntaxError: Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language.
NameError: Errors reported when the interpreter detects an object that is unknown.
TypeError: Errors thrown when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
There is also another type of error that doesn‚Äôt have error messages that we will cover down the line:

Logic errors: Errors found by the programmer when the program isn‚Äôt doing what it is intending to do.
Remember, Google and Stack Overflow are a programmer‚Äôs BFFs (best friends forever) in situations where an error is giving you a lot of trouble. For some more motivation, check out this blog post.

We wish you the best of luck in your bug-squashing journey! üîé
